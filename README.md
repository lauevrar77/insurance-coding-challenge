# Yago Technical Challenge

## Design decisions
### Using a complete web framework
For this technical challenge, I decided to use a features-full web framework ([Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)). 

I hesitated for a long time between Django and using a more minimalist framework (where I would have more things to do by myself). My thinking was that this kind of framework does a lot of things for you and that may not be suitable for a technical test (as a technical test is made for you to show your abilities, not the ones of the web framework).

I finaly decided to select Django as :
- When seniority of a developper grows, he often use simpler and simpler approach (KISS)
- In a production environment, this kind of features-full web framework is the most suitable
- It allows to focus on the business case and not technical details
- It certainly ensure a more robust app
- It reduces the time to market of a feature
- Yago uses this kind of web framework (Rails)
- Django is quite similar to Rails
- Django automaticaly provides an admin interface that allows Yago's salespeople to see the lead's contact information
